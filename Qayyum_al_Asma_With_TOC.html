The air is ripe with expectation of the coming of the Messiah, the Arrival of the Qa'im, the Return of the 12th Imam. You have studied these matters deeply, reviewed the traditions, and found a brotherhood of fellow souls awakened and aware of this oncoming event. After the passing of your spiritual master, who left you with the astounding instructions: seek out the Promised One, whose arrival is imminent. You've been entrusted with this goal of recognizing that Holy Soul. You fast and seclude yourself for 40 days in the desert to attain a state of utmost purity and sanctity. You enter the ancient city of Shiraz and almost accidentally come across a mysterious youth who invites you into his home. It is evening (5 Jumáda al-Úlá 1260 - May 1844). He is familiar with your community (the Shaykhi school) and knows, without you sharing, that you are in search of this Promised figure. Without prompting, He declares Himself the object of your search. He launches rapidly, unasked and entirely without premeditation, into the revelation of a commentary on the Surih of Joseph, the 12th chapter of the Holy Qur'an. You had cherished hope, but had not said outloud, that a sign of the Promised One would be the revelation of a commentary on this Surih. He recites, simultaneous to His Writing, and His melodious voice captures your heart. His words let spark to your spiritually enlivened being, and you enter a state of rapture. The night swiftly passes in a dreamlike state. This youth, who declares that He is 'the Bab', had revealed what became the first Surih, the Surih of Mulk (Sovereignty), of His first mighty Book, the Qayyúm al-Asmá'. Over a period of 40 days that followed, He would complete this work with a Surih devoted to each verse of the 12th chapter of the Qur'an, and replete with mysteries and secrets that remain waiting to be explored to this day and far beyond it. “This Revelation,” says Mullá Ḥusayn, the witness and recipient of this experience, “so suddenly and impetuously thrust upon me, came as a thunderbolt which, for a time, seemed to have benumbed my faculties. I was blinded by its dazzling splendor and overwhelmed by its crushing force." This Book would become His singular and most weighty Book until the Revelation of the Bayan; it is a work spanning thousands of verses and over 112,000 words. That the very first emanation of His Pen after declaring His identity to His first follower would attain the level of impact that it did, and provoke the events that followed, and would remain for a span of years the most important work in an expansive, mystically charged and ___ , is nothing short of astounding. For some of His followers it would be practically the only work of His they would ever know, and yet it ignited the fire of devotion strongly enough to lay down their entire lives, to leave their families and devote themselves entirely to this Message. This was the case of Mulla Ali Bastami; the QA was the work that invited the Ulama of Karbila to arise against His teaching efforts and sentenced Him to imprisonment and led to his death in captivity. He would never know more of the Bab than that initial fire that was sparked in His soul and the words that he knew from the QA.</li><li>The Qayyum’u’l-Asmá was the opening salvo that ignited a firestorm that consumed the country of Persia for over 2 decades. It is rare, or perhaps unheard of, that the first work of any author receives so much attention immediately upon its release. The QA provoked an unheard of response amongst an audience both prepared and radically unsuspecting. They were prepared in that the spirit of the "End of Days" permeated many circles, high and low. But they were unprepared at the absolute creativity, novelty, mystery, and power that this work invited, the challenges it provoked against preconceived notions, as well as every single subsequent Word of the Bab that only further deepened that mystery and newness brought on by His highly charged and unique Revelation.</li><li>The Báb Himself was but a humble merchant of the city of Shiraz; He was no rising star of the Learned and intellectual elite. He was not trained in any of the formal branches of knowledge that were prized in 19th-century Persia. He, as He Himself attests, and as testified by those who knew Him, spoke and composed entirely via the inspirations and descent of revelation upon His heart and mystical commune with God. That He spoke with such intensity, creativity, and sheer fluency on the bewildering range of topics that He did, is nothing short of a miraculous feat; indeed it is almost inconceivable. Hundreds of the most renowned intellects throughout Persia allied themselves with His Cause in recognition of the majesty of His word and the allure of His Person. Not only were His works electrifying, but so to was His Presence and Personhood, which had dramatic effects on any who came into contact with Him. As He reveals in His later works, these (the Book and the Personhood) are constitutive and bound elements of the singular reality of the "Manifestation of God" and the doctrine of divine theophany, the central and most important theological topic in the entirety of His works.</li><li>Comprising 111 Surahs and spanning thousands of verses and over 112,000 words, the Qayyúm al-Asmá' is no traditional commentary. It radically integrates the Qur'án's text with the Báb's own divine revelation, using prophetic language, disconnected letters, and a hypertextual style that challenges conventional distinctions between commentator and divine verse and shattered conceptions on the meaning and identity of widely expected messianic figures and concepts. This distinctive approach deliberately asserted His claim to direct divine revelation (wahy and nzl), effectively elevating His work to the status of a "new Qur'án" while simultaneously "re-revealing" the original Qur'án through it's fluent reworkings of Quranic verses and fascinating ways. Its unprecedented novelty, innovative style, and deeply messianic content instantly electrified its early readership, provoking upheavals across Persia that lasted over two decades and leading tens of thousands of followers to lay down their lives for the Message. That it had this impact is all the more stunning knowing that this was but the First major work the Bab produced after His open declaration to His initial discipline. Despite this monumental and frankly shocking impact on Iranian history and effect on the religious world generally, the text has been little studied since its inception, especially outside Babi/Baha'i contexts, and even within them. Only in recent history have some of its mysteries begun to be unravelled as a new generation of scholarship has started processing this weighty and challenging work. The aim of this compilation is to accelerate efforts to comprehensively study the Writings of the Primal Point by making available for the first time all available authorized and provisional translations (from recognized scholars and experts) of this work in a single document, alongside introductory material and thematic analysis.</li></ul><li><b>Circumstances of Revelation</b></li><ul><li>Muhammad Afnan, in AMNP, argues that the "40 days" of composition should be taken as a consecutive period given that, lingusitically, Persian convention implies consecutive days unless unambiguously stated otherwise. Nosratollah Mohammedhosseini, on the other hand (AMNP p. 7), argues it may not have been exactly consecutive based on textual evidence within the QA. In any case, it is certain that by July 1844 or shortly after, the text was complete, for <a>[[Mullá Alí Bastámí]]</a>, one of the <a>[[Letters of the Living]]</a>, carried a copy of it to <a>[[Karbila]]</a> in late summer 1844, where he soon ignited consternation and retribution from the assembly of learned Sunni and Shi'a clerics who swiftly imprisoned him.</li><li><b>The Rapidity of its Revelation: On the theme of Revelation as Divine Music and Jazzlike Improvisation, the Báb's artistry, A Key Metaphor by Lawson</b></li><ul><li>"...the many distinctive revelatory features or "literary events" in the Qayyúm al-Asma ... that thrilled and enthused the early readership and presented them with an evidentiary miracle of the first order. ... this occurred on a number of counts. First is the fact that this text was revealed with great rapidity, without lucubration or study, in the presence of witnesses; second, it was composed by one who was not a professional religious scholar, poet or litterateur but a young man of the merchant class comparatively uneducated; three, and perhaps most importantly, it demonstrates that the author had a truly awe-inspiring control over the entire Qurän whose verses, partial verses, words and references here are just so many keys of a textual piano played by a master— if self-taught—musician, extempore." (Lawson, 'The Role of Wonder...', p. 11)</li></ul></ul><li><b>Form and Stylistic Features</b></li><ul><li>Divided in 111 named Surah of [approx.] 42 verses each. According to Phelps, Partial Inventory, the QA comprises some 112,000 words. Each Surah begins with the Bismillah, and disconnected letters [huruf al-Muqatta’at] as do many Quranic Surah. The book is written in saj (rhyming prose) rhyming on ‘a’. The near exact correspondence with the Quran is notable, which has 114 Surah. The number of Surah both mirrors closely the length of the Quran while also directly corresponding to the number of verses in the Surih of Joseph (111 verses).</li><li>The claims to ‘Revelation’ - including wahy and nzl - such as [Awha alayka] revealed unto you, or an [anzala alayka] 'sent down upon you'. These two words are reserved for prophetic divine revelation, inspiration (which would be ilham).</li><li>The organization into 'Surah' is not simply a likeness or just unconventional, it reinforces the claim to divine revelation by inherently elevating its status as akin to the Quran or even as a ‘new Quran’.</li><li>Relatedly, the use of 'disconnected letters' at the beginnings of each Surah issues a further claim to concordance with the Quran. Certain sets of letters match Quranic patterns; others are entirely new, and some form distinctive 'messages' (cf. QA Surah 108 and 109, QA57). Many may near distinctive abjad values that correspond to meaningful terms, although a full exploration of this is premature at this time. On disconnected letters, the Bab also made use of disconnected letters in another early stage work, the <a>[[Kitáb al-Rúh]]</a></li><li>The structure of each Surah further reinforces likeness to the Quran. Like the Quran, the place of revelation is related at the top of each Surah (invariably they are all Shiraz given the period of its composition); the Surah begin with disconnected letters; within the Text the term 'Quran' (the Recitation) and 'Furqan' (the Criterion) are used to refer to itself. Unlike traditional commentaries, the text does not use conventional interceding words such as "ay" and "ya'ni" or "I say" which serve in the genre of commentary to clearly distinguish the commentator from the divine verse (Lawson, GA, p. 38) and as a way of avoiding intermingling. The disregard of the convention in what is ostensibly a commentary is intentional.</li><li>Ostensibly the QA is a commentary, however it is a 'commentary' unlike any ever written, which often have rather standard formats and conventional genre restraints and expected patterns. The QA contradicts these in deliberate ways. For one thing, commentaries traditionally provide a portion of the Quran, dive directly into the meaning, interpretation, grammatical points, and circumstances of revelation. The text of the Quran itself is given prominence and is directly separated from the commentary. However, in the QA the text being 'commented' upon is directly integrated into the Author's writing-Revelation, blending them in an enigmatic way, with no clear delineation between the quranic divine verse and the purported authorial voice [cf. Lawson, 'The Role of Wonder...' p. 8]. The Surah also veer away from direct commentary and explore a wide array of themes, restating and re-revealing quranic verses, even from many sections of the Quran outside the Surah of Joseph. In this sense it is radically hypertextual, and requires a distinctive level of fluency in the Quran. It is deliberately "tafsir-i-ta'wili" (esoteric interpretation). Oftentimes the direct verse in question is only finally commented on at the end of the surah in allegorical or abstruse manners (more ta'wil than tafsir). The QA can be said to be commentary and Quranic exegesis, a re-revelation of the original Qu'ran, and an entirely new Book in its own right, hence why it was regarded, until late in the Báb's ministry (with the Revelation of the Persian Bayan), as the central text and "Quran" of the Babi religion. In many respects (form, substance, magnitude) it can still be regarded as such, because the Bayan, while claiming cosubstantiality with the Quran, is remarkably distinct and truly 'new' in character, and not quranic in style or format, while also being a Revelation in Persian verses. One might ask, given the unconventional nature of the commentary, that clearly offended guardians of the traditional style who rebuked it for it's "failures" to adhere to accepted standards, what truly is the nature of the 'commentary' of the QA? For this we can turn to its own literary self-conception, as it declares with startling audacity: “O people of the earth, This Book (= the QA) is the tafsir of everything (li-kulli shay’).” (QA Surih 111:30; prov. transl. by Lambden, "From a Primal Point to an Archetypal Book Literary Trajectories through Select Writings of the Bab (1819–50)" in Vahman, TBBC, p. 194). It is precisely because of its novelty, innovativeness, and deeply messianic content that so impressed those first drawn to it and electrified them into association with the Babi movement - one that quickly became the subject of fierce persecution.</li><li>The type of visionary and seamless integration of the Quran, expressive of a deep mastery over its contents, is not completely without precedent in that Quran quotation has obviously been an integral part of various philosophical mystical works prior. However the distinction is that few of those works have gone to the extent that the QA has in it's recapitulation, alteration and ____. The nearest approximation might be the work of <a>[[Ibn Arabi]]</a> , so inventive and seamless in its integration and utilization of the Quran. Other examples and styles useful for comparison are <a>[[Suhrawardi]]</a>, in his 'mystical allegories' and <a>[[Mulla Sadra]]</a> (see for example 'Elixir...'). Such works are not Quran 'commentary' however, and so their form and purposes are distinguishable in intent. For instance, besides Ibn Arabi, Suhrawardi and Mulla Sadra are firmly "philosophical" projects, so the impetus to integrate the Quran was distinctive, though both were renowned for the novelty of their style of integrating the Quran.</li><li>It’s worth noting that the Báb divides His works generally into 5 categories [the Five Modes, Panj Sha'n] in the Persian Bayan and related texts (such as the eponymous <a>[[Kitab-i-Panj Sha‘n]]</a> ). On the one hand the QA would fall under the 'tafsir' mode of Revelation. However he does state in the <a>[[Dalá’il-i-Sab’ih]]</a> that some of His tafsirs on the Qur'an,  despite being named as such, are in fact in the revelatory style of verses (áyát), and some others are in the "technical style of the perfect 'ulama [kalimát-i mustalihih bayn 'ulamá-yi kammalín]" (27). The QA is of the first type while the <a>[[tafsir Súrat al-Baqarah]]</a> is of the second (see Behmardi, McCants, ‘Stylistic Features’).</li><li>Repetition: not unlike the Quran, repetition in the QA is one of its distinctive styles. One scarcely can encounter any Surah that does not have some repeating pattern, and most Surih feature repetitions that thread throughout the entire length of the work. One way of viewing this stylistic feature is in the context of the Quran and the QA as works dssigned to be recited. Many verses make sense chiefly in the context of such recitation and are clearly designed around the mystical experience of speaking the word. Another dimension of this is the mantra like pattern of the practice of <a>[[dhikr (remembrance)]]</a> : “In the Qayyúm al-Asmá, words like haqq (Truth), akbar (most great), kitáb (book), and nár (fire) are frequently repeated. Moreover, haqq is repeated in most of the verses of the Qayyúm al-Asmá. For example, the word haqq is repeated in the first Sura (al-Mulk) 47 times, in the second Sura (al-‘Ulamá') 41 times, in the third Sura (al-Imán) 25 times, in the fourth Sura (al-Madína) 33 times, and so forth until the last Sura (al-Mu'minin) where it is repeated 50 times, which is more than the number of its verses.” (Behmardi, McCants ‘Stylistic Analysis…’) The text and interaction with it is intended to be an unfolding devotional process, not necsssarily designed to be "read" cover to cover, in a rationalistic manner (indeed this is true of the Quran as well). In other works the Bab ordained that His collective works be arranged in a most perfect and novel order, with sequences of different revelatory modes, and set numbers of passages from different works arranged in a particular order. Hence the pattern of repetition that is experienced in reading several surah in a row is probably more intended to be completed alongside other styles, and the repeating pattern serves a purpose in that kind of arrangement that is distinct from reading them all in sequence.</li><li>Named Surahs identical with titles in the Quran, totalling some 15 corresponding names (some appearing more than once in the QA)</li><ul><li>Mulk, Yusuf, al-Tawhid, al-Nur, al-Nasr, al-Insan, al-Hamd, al-Qalam, al-Kahf, al-Shams, al-Anbiya, al-Nahl, al-Hajj, al-Jum'a, al-Mu'minin.</li></ul><li>The length of most surahs are consistently 3-6 pages.</li><li>The distinction of 'rhyming prose' and poetry is not so much a lack of rhythm to accompany the rhyme, but more so a lack of standardized pattern. Momen in AMNP Ch. 7: "In fact, both rhyme and rhythm are present. The only reason that it is not possible to call it poetry, in the classical literary meaning of this word, is the fact that the rhyme and rhythm do not follow any uniform or regular pattern and there are short passages of prose linking parts of the text." Furthermore, one must also weighs the classical distinctions between poetry and Revelation, between the poet, the mystic and the Revelator, as these may seem to be overlapping at times in modes of expression; in fact, pains were taken to ensure a figure such as the Prophet Muhammad were not seen as merely 'poets' but indeed as Revelators [include Quranic quotes on this matter here]. The QA also features alliteration prominently. Much of the QA rhymes with ending in "-an", or the accusative mode.</li><li>Key to Concordance and Discordance between Surah Titles</li><ul><li><a href="https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/slambden/03-THE%20BAB/QAYYUM%20AL-ASMA'/surahs-huruf/surahs.htm">https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/slambden/03-THE%20BAB/QAYYUM%20AL-ASMA'/surahs-huruf/surahs.htm</a></li></ul><li>On the Matter of the Arabic Grammar... <b>On the Matter of the Arabic Grammar of the Báb and His Aesthetics of Revelation</b> <a>#Arabic</a></li></ul><li><b>The Background and Significance of Joseph and Surah of Joseph</b></li><ul><li>Joseph’s story comprises Genesis 37-50 of the Hebrew Bible, but is mentioned elsewhere as in Exodus 13:19 , Joshua 24:32.

But in chapter 36 the Báb says by Husayn is meant Jacob because the Báb, the divine Joseph, is a descendant of Husayn." [AMNP, p. 11]</li></ul></ul><li>The Messianic and Prophetic Relevance of Joseph's story</li><ul><li>Mohammadhosseini in AMNP p. 22 observes: "The reasons why the Báb chose the story of Joseph to interpret are quite clear. The Islamic hadith state that the promised Qá' im will resemble the prophet Joseph. The story of Joseph's life was almost identical to that of all the prophets: they were all subject to the perfidy of their brothers in religion, were thrown into the well of jealousy and were sold for a paltry price; many were imprisoned, some were killed; but in the end their Cause was victorious."</li><li>Beyond this, the figure of Joseph has taken on increasing significance and grew widely popular as centuries went on - this reached a peak in the 1 or 2 centuries preceding the Báb.

There are innumerable references regarding the Day of Resurrection, the Day of Judgment, and there are some indications that Jesus' Return (as prophesied in the Gospels and Book of Revelation) is still forthcoming. However, there are countless references to these figures in hadith and notably in statements from the Imams, especially <a>[[Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq]]</a>.

These are referred to within the Text as the 'Beautiful Names' or 'Best Names' (al-Husna al-Asmá') in several locations (cf. Q7:180, Q20:8, Q59:24), and the Quran itself is the major source of the Names of God, often traditionally given as 99 in number. The Names of God are emphasized in the Quran as a focal point of devotional practice/remembrance [dhikr]: “Remember (athkur) the Name of thy Lord, and dedicate thyself unto Him utmost devotion”. (Q73:8) One question for further research is whether the Bab affirms only Islamic/Quranic Names in the QA, or introduces unfamiliar or novel names as He does later in the 3,000+ page <a>[[Kitab ul-Asmá’]]</a>.</li></ul><li><b>Defamiliarizing and Refamiliarizing the Qur'án, to Familiarize the Asmá'.</b></li><ul><li>[Forthcoming]</li><li>In recognizing that the QA has an inextricable connection to the Quran, we must contend with the unique challenge of being familiar with the QA. First is that knowledge of the Quran is essential. Second, that we recognize the challenging quality of the Quran, which has a bearing on how we understand the QA, given the shared material and shared aspects reflected in itscontent, style, and structure. And thirdly, that we have to understand the uniquely challenging content and style of the QA that demands its own assessment.</li><li>There is a three-pronged effort to made here, then. One is that for those unfamiliar with the Quran, one needs to build a deep engagement with it. Meanwhile those familiar with the Quran may need to defamiliarize it so as not to confuse the ways it recapitulates the Quran (and how it changes them in ways that challenge those familiar with the Quran), but also to recognize how it differs. And finally to see the QA entirely in its own light so as not to 'miss the forest for the trees', which is the more important: <i>why</i> it differs.</li><li>Perhaps this forms part of what the Bab means when He states in Surah 29:22 "In very truth hath God established ... a veil between thee and the unbelievers in terms of the comprehension of the Qur'an (tilawat al-qur'an)." [Lambden, prov. transl.]. Regardless, this clearly compels us to reexamine what we think we know about the Qur'an.</li><li>Understanding of the Style of the Quran</li><ul><li>The combines the personal (salvific), societal (moral civilizational), and mystical (esoteric). Highly terse and elliptical, allusive and self-referential, non-linear, reliant on allusion over report-like facticity and exhaustiveness. Quranic Arabic is very reliant on subtext, such that translators often have to mark out words not in the original but implied in the statements and necessary for understanding. We will find all these are true also of the QA.</li><li>Compared to the Torah and the Bible, the goal of the Qu'ran is universalizing 'sacred history' (not restricted to chosen people) and, for believers, it is recognized as directly revealed as opposed to a collection of human-mediated reports. The style of the history is instructional, aiming towards imparting ethical and spiritual lessons of the events, versus the onorous and genealogical style of the Torah, or the more purely narrative style of the Gospels [cf. Nasr, the Study Qur'an].</li><li>Uniquely designed around recitation and linguistic quality of expression.  How one recites the text, your rhythm, pauses, stresses and pronunciations changes the experience of hearing <a>[[the Word of God]]</a>. This reflects both the way Muhammad received the Revelation, but also how He delivered it (recitation), and connects listeners throughout time with the experience of hearing the Arabic as though one was listening to it being revealed. This dimension of recitation and style is also relevant to the QA.</li><li>How to read the Quran, and lessons for the QA, [cf. <a>[[Studying the Qur'an for Baha'i Scholarship]]</a> [forthcoming].</li><li>Lawson reminds us of the Hadith that 'when the Qaim comes He will bring a Book that will be a terrible challenge to the Arabs' [cf. 'On the Matter of the Arabic Grammar of the Bab'] (forthcoming).</li></ul></ul><li><b>The History of Qurʾān-like Works and Attempts to Recreate the Qurʾān</b></li><ul><li>The original Qurʾānic injunction and challenge of 'inimitability' ('ijaz) [cf. Q10:38, Q17:88 Q11:13 and more aside], one of the defining features of the Qurʾān's status as the Word of God is the warning against and declaration of the futility of attempts to imitate it. This has in many ways formed a centerpiece of Islamic identity from the origin of Islam as a religion and its reverence for the Book. Although rare, attempts have been made to imitate the Quran, with roots leading back to the early centuries of Islam. Broadly, not all attempts were deliberately challenging or mocking, since some were Muslims themselves engaged in literary exercises or otherwise sincere efforts to admire the Qur'an, although this wouldn't necessarily prevent being impugned as a blasphemous practice. The QA can be considered historically in light of its place within this (necessarily controversial) tradition, and although certainly invoking the ire of many Muslims on account of the deeply held reverence and belief in the impossibility of imitation, the QA must be viewed primarily within the scope of the Bab's own deep love and unparalleled reverence for the Qur'an as well as His claims to Revelation and superogative co-identification of Himself with Muhammad, and His Book with that of the Qurʾān. Finally, there is also the matter of the widespread messianic expectations that took root in the Islamic community even from its earliest years. This is especially so in Shi'i Islam, where such traditions as 'the Hidden Book' being in the hands of the Imam's, or the Imam's being seen as the 'Speaking Book' counterpart to the 'Silent Book' [i.e. the Qurʾān], and indications that the Day of eschatological fulfilment would bring a 'New Book' and a 'New Law', are all deserving of attention. These and others expositions of the underlying truths of the Word of God, the meaning of 'Book', the eternal progression/procession of Revelation and the Return of God's Manifestations are all themes that are either manifested or latent in the QA, and later further explicated and fully unveiled in the Persian Bayan; these form the core theological justification and claim of the Bab in response to contests against His Dispensation. Further, there is the Bab's very own claims towards <a>#inimitability</a> which are replete throughout the text of the QA, as well as in the Persian Bayan. In the QA such examples begin from the vert start and reappear regularly [cf. QA 1; QA2; QA43; QA57, and more aside].</li><ul><li>Other notable attempts or Quran-like works to consider for comparison:</li><ul><li>Early on, Musaylima (reportedly). The formerly Manichaen Persian translator of the 8th c. CE / 2nd c. AH, Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ or Ruzbih, reportedly had attempted to imitate the Quran and earned him a reputation as a heretic. Such later revelatory adjacent works among Ḥurūfiyya Shi'a.  These and similar are reviewed in Sherman, William (2024). "Finding the Qur'an in Imitation: Critical Mimesis from Musaylima to Finnegans Wake". ReOrient. 9 (1). Pluto Journals: 50–69. doi:10.13169/reorient.9.1.0050.</li><li><a>[[Ibn Arabi]]</a> in his "Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya" makes allusive connections between the 114 Surih of the Quran and the 114 sections the Futuhat which deal with the 'spiritual abodes' (<i>fasl al-manāzil</i>). See Chodkiewicz's <a href="https://ibnarabisociety.org/the-futuhat-makkiyya-and-its-commentators-michel-chodkiewicz/">The Futūḥāt Makkiyya and its Commentator: Some Unresolved Enigmas."</a> for explorations of this enigmatic Quran allusions: "initial observations are enough to allow us to anticipate the conclusion that each of the 114 chapters in the fasl al-manāzil in fact corresponds to a Surah and – more or less allusively – conveys its esoteric significance."</li></ul></ul></ul><li><b>Understanding the Immediate Audience of the Qayyúm al-Asmá'</b></li><ul><li>[Forthcoming]</li><li><b>Understanding the Apocalypse: Reviewing Prevalent Messianic Expectations</b></li><ul><li>[Forthcoming]</li><li>The Imams were said to have ‘the hidden book’, the true copy of the Quran of the <a>[[Imam 'Ali]]</a> with them, and the hidden Imam was said to have this book. Lawson reminds us of the Hadith that 'when the Qaim comes He will bring a Book that will be a terrible challenge to the Arabs'. [cf. 'On the Matter of the Arabic Grammar of the Bab'] (forthcoming).</li><li>See also: <a>[[Al-Mahdi and Al-Qa'im in Islamic Expectations]]</a>.</li><li>For apocalyptic sentiments in the Qur'an, e.g. the destruction of this world of a new creation by God, see for example 14:19, 48; 35:15.</li><li><b>Why did Mulla Husayn anticipate a commentary on the Surih of Joseph?</b></li><ul><li>Nosratollah Mohammadhosseini comments on this in his chapter on "The Commentary on the Sura of Joseph", in the collection A Most Noble Pattern (p. 10). He notes that the origin of Siyyid Kazim's expectation that the Qa'im would reveal interpretations and unravel the mysteries of the Surah come from within the verses from that Surah, including verse 7 and verses 109-111.<p>				  <br />				  Q12:7 "Indeed, in the story of Joseph and his brothers there are lessons for all who ask." and also Q12:112 "There is a lesson in the stories of such people for those who understand. This revelation is no fabrication: it is a confirmation of the truth of what was sent before it; an explanation of everything; a guide and a blessing for those who believe."<br /></p></li><li>It became part of Shi'a messianic expectations that the coming Mahdi or Qa'im would reveal such lessons, explicate [bayan!] the Qur'an, and that this would constitute part of their proof to the people of the end times. Paired with the Shi'a idea that the Qur'an is <i>with</i> the Imams, and that the Surah of Joseph is particularly loved as the 'Best of Stories' and was a major part of many interpretations in the Islamic community, it becomes clearer why it became the centerpiece of the Bab's declaration and that the expectation would be that He would reveal a major novel interpretation of it. The Bab also personally had a very strong personal attachment and identification with the figure of Joseph. (On these themes, see AMNP, p. 10; Lawson, GA, chapter 1)</li></ul></ul><li><b>The History of the Reception of the QA</b></li><ul><li>Notably, <a>[[Haji Mirza Karim Khan Kirmani]]</a>, the rival claimaint to leadership of <a>[[shaykhi]]</a> movement after the death of <a>[[Siyyid Kāzim Rashti]]</a>, wrote a polemical critique of the Bab and His claims to divine revaltion, as well as His unorthodox grammar (see On the Matter of the Arabic Grammar... <b>On the Matter of the Arabic Grammar of the Báb and His Aesthetics of Revelation</b> <a>#Arabic</a> ). This work (Izhaaq al-baatil) was written as early as 17 July 1845, scarcely a year after the QA's composition.</li><ul><li>See, McCants, A Grammar of the Divine, AMNP, p. 71: "In the section on 'Examples of Some of the Simple Minded Drivel of the Suspicious Báb' (di dhikri ba di khuráfáti al-báb al-murtáb, pp. 80-103), Kirmáni criticizes the grammar and content of an early letter sent to him by the Báb and chapters of the Qayyúm al-Asmá'. His criticisms on both counts are illuminating since he was a well-educated man steeped in the intricacies of both Arabic grammar and Shaykhi terminology. With regard to the former, he was well positioned to pick out a number of grammatical and stylistic integularities in the Báb's writings that might normally escape the attention of less capable readers (such as myself). Even though his aim is polemical (to prove that the Báb is not eloquent (<i>fasiih</i>), as the latter had claimed), his observations are helpful in understanding what was so striking about the Báb's prose to an educated audience. Even more valuable are his criticisms of the Báb's claims to divine authority in the Qayyúm al-Asmá'. Kirmáni was one of a handful of people who knew enough of Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kázim's terminology to be able to decipher the Báb's language in that book and he makes the imporant point that the Báb was claiming multiple stations at the same time. To prove his point, he goes verse by verse in several chapters and 'decodes" the Báb's cryptic claims. The chapter is an invaluable source for understanding how the Báb's early works were received by the religious elite"</li></ul></ul></ul><li><b>See also "The Intimate Connection between..."</b> The intimate connection between His earliest major work (<a>[[Qayyúm al-Asmá']]</a> and His penultimate (the Bayán)</li><ul><li>Muhammad Afnan observes: "there are many similarities... including the mode and method of revelation, their explanation of both the generalities and the details of spiritual knowledge, and their exposition of the laws and principles of religion" (A Most Noble Pattern, p. 4)</li><li>In the QA, the station of the Báb is disclosed symbolically and evidently, but also concealed. Still, there are many indications of His divine mission and station. In the Bayán these all become fully manifest and articulated. The Bab deliberately states in the <a>[[Qayyúm al-Asmá']]</a> (Surah 5 and 74) that his station is veiled but will later be revealed. This is followed upon directly in the Persian Bayan in  [cf. A Most Noble Pattern, p. 13]. If we turn to the Quran, we can see in the all-important Surah 75, Surat al-Qiyamah, a possible indication of this exact phenomena occuring in the pattern of God's Revelation. The opening of this Surah establishes the theme of the coming Day of Resurrection [qiyamah] [Q75:1-15]. The surah references the theme of firstness and lastness, "On that Day, man will be told what he put first and what he put last." [Q75:13] (cf. the theme of 'the End in the Beginning, the Beginning in the End', Seven Valleys). It then testifies that first comes 'a recitation' [qur'an], then it is incumbent upon [God and the Messenger] to 'explain it' [bayan], al-Qiyamah: "Verily, it is incumbent upon Us [God] to collect it and recite it [qur'ánahu]. If we recite it [qara'náhu], follow thou its recital [qur'ánahu]. Then it is incumbent upon us to explain it [`alayná bayánahu].” (Qur'an 75:17-19). Following this pattern and applying this to the Bab's Revelation, He produced 'a Recitation' [His Qur'an, His First Book]. Later, it was incumbent upon Him to 'explain' it [His Bayan], His Ultimate Book [e.g. it is 'the Unerring Balance until the Day of HWGSMM']. Although this excerpt (Q75:15-19) is considered by interpreters (cf. Ibn Abbas) as contemporary references to Muhammad's receipt of Revelation; the question is whether it can also be framed in the same way as the rest of the entire surah, which concerns the Day of Resurrection. Either way, this same pattern also occurs in Surah ar-Rahman, further supporting it as a pattern/indication: "The Most Compassionate, taught the Qur'an (recitation), ['allamal Qur'an], created humanity, and taught them speech [AAallamahu albayan, or also 'taught them the Bayan']." (Qur'an 55:1-4).</li><li>The QA can be seen as an initial effort to establish the relationship of the Bab's messianic arrival with the existing laws and institutions of Islam. The QA is not the principal repository of the Babi laws. That role would be filled by the Bayan of 3-4 years later. In the earliest layers of the Bab's revelation as seen in the QA and related works, generally and apparently, the Laws of Islam such as those related to jihad, homicide, hajj, zakah, ribah, inheritance, and marriage are confirmed and upheld. He does accompany these with what might be considered 'heterodox' interpretations or perspectives on them. However, later on it becomes clear that the Bab intends to and ultimately does modify or abolish these laws ('irtifa). In the QA this impulse is present but latent. By the time of the fruition of the Arabic and Persian Bayan, this becomes manifest and evident [A Most Noble Pattern, p. 20]. In this sense, the earlier concealment can be seen as an act of <i>taqiyya</i>, initially in a bifurcated simultaneous unveiling and denial of the messianic claims. J. Vahid Brown deftly describes this a "range of revelation and concealment", elusive and encrypted (A Most Noble Pattern, p. 89).</li></ul><li><b>The Relationship of the Qayyúm al-Asmá' with other Quranic Commentaries of the Bab</b></li><ul><li>[Forthcoming]</li><li><a>[[tafsir Súrat al-Baqarah]]</a></li><ul><li>In PB3:16, He states that TSB was revealed in the mode 'scientific educational discourse'.</li></ul><li><a>[[Tafsīr Sūrat al-Kawthar]]</a></li><ul><li>Cf.

Inwardly, the Book prepares its readers for the emergence of a hidden cause, a Mystery to be unveiled and gives indication of a future messianic appearance.

Thus on the Day of Resurrection God will ask everyone of his understanding and not of his following in the footsteps of others. How often a person, having inclined his ears to the holy verses, would bow down in humility and would embrace the Truth, while his leader would not do so. Thus every individual must bear his own responsibility, rather than someone else bearing it for him. At the time of the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest the most distinguished among the learned and the lowliest of men shall both be judged alike. How often the most insignificant of men have acknowledged the truth, while the most learned have remained wrapt in veils.

From the time of the revelation of the Qur'an until the number nineteen was to be manifested - which number must needs appear - were the outward members of Muhammad's Family, each number revolving around one letter of "In the Name of God, the Compassionate," and four of them increased according to the form of the four collective words which passed in the time of the pure Shi'ih, namely Haji Siyyid Kazim, upon him be the blessings of God and His peace.

The year 1260 concludeth, and every six is the manifestation of the Mystery of Muhammad and His Family, upon them be the blessings of God and all His glory. And since the manifestation of the Mystery is the manifestation of God, not their manifestation through prophethood and guardianship, but rather through the manifestation of divinity, it was from this manifestation that appeared the declaration "Verily I am God, there is no God but Me." And at the time of manifestation, the first to pledge allegiance to Him was Muhammad, as the text of the tradition </i>*attesteth, then the Commander of the Faithful, then the Imams, peace be upon them.

I was enthralled by the music of that voice which rose and fell as He chanted; now swelling forth as He revealed verses of the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, again acquiring ethereal, subtle harmonies as He uttered the prayers He was revealing. At the end of each invocation, He would repeat this verse: ‘Far from the glory of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, be that which His creatures affirm of Him! And peace be upon His Messengers! And praise be to God, the Lord of all beings!’” “This Revelation,” Mullá Ḥusayn has further testified, “so suddenly and impetuously thrust upon me, came as a thunderbolt which, for a time, seemed to have benumbed my faculties. I was blinded by its dazzling splendor and overwhelmed by its crushing force. Excitement, joy, awe, and wonder stirred the depths of my soul. Predominant among these emotions was a sense of gladness and strength which seemed to have transfigured me. How feeble and impotent, how dejected and timid, I had felt previously! Then I could neither write nor walk, so tremulous were my hands and feet. Now, however, the knowledge of His Revelation had galvanized my being. I felt possessed of such courage and power that were the world, all its peoples and its potentates, to rise against me, I would, alone and undaunted, withstand their onslaught. The universe seemed but a handful of dust in my grasp. I seemed to be the voice of Gabriel personified, calling unto all mankind: ‘Awake, for, lo! the morning Light has broken. Arise, for His Cause is made manifest. The portal of His grace is open wide; enter therein, O peoples of the world! For He Who is your promised One is come!’”" (Shoghi Effendi, <a href="www.bahai.org/r/175540364">God Passes By</a> )</li><li>"A more significant light, however, is shed on this episode, marking the Declaration of the Mission of the Báb, by the perusal of that “first, greatest and mightiest” of all books in the Bábí Dispensation, the celebrated commentary on the Súrih of Joseph, the first chapter of which, we are assured, proceeded, in its entirety, in the course of that night of nights from the pen of its divine Revealer. The description of this episode by Mullá Ḥusayn, as well as the opening pages of that Book attest the magnitude and force of that weighty Declaration. A claim to be no less than the mouthpiece of God Himself, promised by the Prophets of bygone ages; the assertion that He was, at the same time, the Herald of One immeasurably greater than Himself; the summons which He trumpeted forth to the kings and princes of the earth; the dire warnings directed to the Chief Magistrate of the realm, Muḥammad Sháh; the counsel imparted to Ḥájí Mírzá Áqásí to fear God, and the peremptory command to abdicate his authority as grand vizir of the Sháh and submit to the One Who is the “Inheritor of the earth and all that is therein”; the challenge issued to the rulers of the world proclaiming the self-sufficiency of His Cause, denouncing the vanity of their ephemeral power, and calling upon them to “lay aside, one and all, their dominion,” and deliver His Message to “lands in both the East and the West”—these constitute the dominant features of that initial contact that marked the birth, and fixed the date, of the inception of the most glorious era in the spiritual life of mankind." (Shoghi Effendi, <a href="www.bahai.org/r/175540364">God Passes By</a> )</li><li>"Already in Shíráz, at the earliest stage of His ministry, He had revealed what Bahá’u’lláh has characterized as “the first, the greatest, and mightiest of all books” in the Bábí Dispensation, the celebrated commentary on the súrih of Joseph, entitled the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, whose fundamental purpose was to forecast what the true Joseph (Bahá’u’lláh) would, in a succeeding Dispensation, endure at the hands of one who was at once His arch-enemy and blood brother. This work, comprising above nine thousand three hundred verses, and divided into one hundred and eleven chapters, each chapter a commentary on one verse of the above-mentioned súrih, opens with the Báb’s clarion-call and dire warnings addressed to the “concourse of kings and of the sons of kings;” forecasts the doom of Muḥammad Sháh; commands his Grand Vizir, Ḥájí Mírzá Áqásí, to abdicate his authority; admonishes the entire Muslim ecclesiastical order; cautions more specifically the members of the Shí‘ah community; extols the virtues, and anticipates the coming, of Bahá’u’lláh, the “Remnant of God,” the “Most Great Master;” and proclaims, in unequivocal language, the independence and universality of the Bábí Revelation, unveils its import, and affirms the inevitable triumph of its Author. It, moreover, directs the “people of the West” to “issue forth from your cities and aid the Cause of God;” warns the peoples of the earth of the “terrible, the most grievous vengeance of God;” threatens the whole Islamic world with “the Most Great Fire” were they to turn aside from the newly-revealed Law; foreshadows the Author’s martyrdom; eulogizes the high station ordained for the people of Bahá, the “Companions of the crimson-colored ruby Ark;” prophesies the fading out and utter obliteration of some of the greatest luminaries in the firmament of the Bábí Dispensation; and even predicts “afflictive torment,” in both the “Day of Our Return” and in “the world which is to come,” for the usurpers of the Imamate, who “waged war against Ḥusayn (Imám Ḥusayn) in the Land of the Euphrates.”" (Shoghi Effendi, <a href="www.bahai.org/r/175540364">God Passes By</a> )</li><li>"It was this Book which the Bábís universally regarded, during almost the entire ministry of the Báb, as the Qur’án of the people of the Bayán; whose first and most challenging chapter was revealed in the presence of Mullá Ḥusayn, on the night of its Author’s Declaration; some of whose pages were borne, by that same disciple, to Bahá’u’lláh, as the first fruits of a Revelation which instantly won His enthusiastic allegiance; whose entire text was translated into Persian by the brilliant and gifted Táhirih; whose passages inflamed the hostility of Ḥusayn Khán and precipitated the initial outbreak of persecution in Shíráz; a single page of which had captured the imagination and entranced the soul of Ḥujjat; and whose contents had set afire the intrepid defenders of the Fort of Shaykh Ṭabarsí and the heroes of Nayríz and Zanján."

The focus of this compilation is on direct translations from the original language into English. Additionally, this compilation will focus primarily on the work of well-recognized contemporary scholars active in Babi-Baha'i Studies whenever possible. The purpose is to emphasize engaged scholars who can be reached regarding their provisional translations for commentary on the translation choices should it be necessary. At times it is necessary to include translations from multiple scholars on the same verses. When possible and instructive these will be provided side-by-side to facilitate comparisons. To facilitate readability and flow, in most cases one translation will be used as the main translation for a verse or surih with others serving as secondary references.</li><li>One of the motivations of this compilation is to provide a rendering of the text with excerpts appearing in the order in which they appear in the original. Although verses, excerpts and quotes from the Holy Writings stand on their own, it is also critical to convey the totality of Revelation through encountering the Sacred Word as it was revealed and arranged. In light of this, this compilation attempts to grant an overview of what portions of the original remain untranslated, and to approach the original ordering of available excerpts.</li><li>All excerpts will be separated by ellipses [ . . . ] to indicate such gaps in the text. Between any two excerpts ellipses will be added with indications of the exact or approximate number of verses omitted [as always, a WIP]. This is helpful in avoiding the illusion (or reinforcing the fact) that certain excerpts come one after the other in succession. When verses do immediately follow one another, no ellipses will added, making it clear when excerpts are in proximity to each other. Similarly, information on the relative or exact length of the various chapters will be indicated when possible [work in progress] to aid readers in gaining a sense of what is present and what remains untranslated. If the length of the gap is suitably short between two excerpts, the original text may be provided and/or provisional translation by the creator of this compilation or others will fill the space. Alternatively, such additions may simply be added to facilitate connections to established themes analyzed within the Subject and Glossary appendices to this compilation. As always, any such additions to the text, including verse ennumeration, ordering and especially added translations and commentary, are entirely provisional.</li><li>Assessing the Validity of Translations</li><ul><li>This compilation follows Baha'i practice in distinguishing between 'authorized' and 'provisional' translations; for more on this topic, see [forthcoming]. As such, all provisional translations will be distinguished from authorized translations by way of indicating the works and or translators they are drawn from.</li><li>All provisional translations will be distinguished from authorized translations by way indicating the works they are drawn from.</li><li>When available and/or particularly helpful, the Arabic original text may be provided as sub-notes to translations.</li><li>Whenever possible as translations are added, reference is made to the original text to ensure the translation is adequately faithful and reliable to the original, although this is not always possible and does not preclude errors. Notable and reputable scholars are generally prioritized partly due to their track records with reliable translations and broad familiarity with the Writings of the Bab. Fully machine translations are avoided. Machine translation in general will be used sparingly if at all, and then only as an aid for a translator with facility with the original languages.</li><li>For ease of comparison (whenever possible), translations are broken down verse by verse. Transliterations are either those included by the referenced translators or otherwise added by the creator of this compilation.</li></ul><li>Reconciling Verses and Surih Titles</li><ul><li>Verse enumeration is a central problem at this early stage in the study of the Asma. It may be different between different sources as the exact versification of the QA remains unclear. Certain authors include things like the Bismillah, the opening verse from the Qu'ran and the disconnected letters as verses 1, 2 and 3, respectively, while others do not. Accounting just the disconnected letters as a verse has precedent in Quranic versification. Here we will generally account them as verse 3 and all subsequent verses as 4 - 42. This versification and references in this document to certain verses are to be considered just as provisional as translations; verse numbering may be subject to change in the future. At present, choices will be made to ensure some form of consistency and/or a general approximation of verses made as much as is useful. This will mostly involve attempting to harmonize verses according to the text available through Sirr-i-Mastur.</li></ul><li>What is a "Critical Edition"?</li><ul><li>[forthcoming]</li></ul><li>Comparison of Machine Learning and AI-based Translations and Human-Translations</li><ul><li>[forthcoming]</li><li>Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT or Claude) are undoubtedly powerful and full length translations of the QA already are possible with these tools. However, the emphasis of this compilation is solely on reliable translations of skilled experts in the language that can give the best possible insights to build knowledge about the work without the possibility of biases introduced by translations that are complete but of insufficient quality.</li></ul><li>Some Textual Analysis</li><ul><li>According to Phelps, S. in "A Partial Inventory", the Qayyúm al-Asmá' comprises some 112,000 words, making it substantially equivalent to the [deliberately unfinished] Persian Bayán in length (approx 106,000 words), mirroring the significance and size of the latter, yet originating at the beginning of the Bab's ministry, compared to the penultimate appearance of the Bayan near it's end. At present, excluding commentary, citations and words used to indicate text locations and structure, this compilation covers approximately 35,000-40,000 [upd. as of 8/1/25] words in translation. It is often the case that translating between languages changes the number of words needed to convey the original text. The same text in English might be on average 1.2 or 1.3 times longer in words when translated into Spanish, while it might get shorter in another language, such as German or Arabic, that has a different 'economy' of word usage. This will naturally differ depending on the context translated. For texts with mystical, scriptural, or symbolic intensity, this effect may be intensified. A range of expected word inflation might fall between 1.2 and 1.5 times the length in the original language for more mystical or technical texts. Arabic is a language with a particularly strong economy and intensity of meaning such that relatively few Arabic words require sometimes twice as many words in English to convey. If we conservatively estimate that translation from Arabic to English led to an inflation of 1.7-1.8x, then we would expect perhaps ~190,000-201,000 words in a complete full English translation of the Qayyúm al-Asmá', equivalent to a 500-600 page book, excluding any background, commentary, footnotes, indices and the like.</li><li>Indeed, comparing the 58 excerpts from the authorized English translation with their respective Arabic original passages, the English passages total just above 8,000 words in total, while the Arabic totals 4,700 words. This matches our tentative expectation of 1.7x the length. This means that the authorized English translation comprises about 4% of the length of the original. Including these passages alongside the provisional translations referenced here, the word total is approx. 35-40k [upd. as of 8/1/25]. Using the above estimate of inflation, we can assume this covers between 17.5-20% of the text of the Qayyúm al-Asmá', substantially increasing access to reliable translations of the text.</li></ul><li>Final Notes</li><ul><li>Any feedback on this compilation is welcome, including corrections, suggestions and requests. Any mistakes are my own entirely. As a reminder, this is not an official resource of the Baha'i Faith. In Baha'i practice and scholarship, provisional translations are those that are produced in a personal capacity by one or more persons and do not hold the same weight as the more rigorous and formal editions published by the guiding institution of the Baha'i Faith. The nature of Baha'i approaches to translation is informed by suggestions from the Central Figures themselves, as well as systematic learning of the Institutions of the Faith and Baha'i scholars; it is a veritable area of study in and of itself and constitutes a unique aspect of the Babi-Bahai dispensations! Given this, what follows, including commentary and especially provisional translations are entirely unauthoritative, except when noted otherwise. This compilation is indebted principally to the work of translators and experts of the original language far more skilled than myself.

Q. 15: 27, 52:27, 56:41). <p>		  <br />		  [10]  Behold, 'Alī said, 'O my [dear little] son [Ḥusayn]!  Do not disclose what God hath enabled thee to vision about thy circumstances (amrika)  unto thy brothers (Q.12:4a):  [keep silent]  as an act of compassion towards them  and, in very truth, as an expression of patience before God,  the Exalted.   And He, God, is  Mighty, Worthy of Praise. [11]  If thou [Ḥusayn] did inform them [the brothers] about thy  [future]  status  (amrika) manifest in the vision, [disclosing] even a fraction  of that which God hath ordained for thee, they [the brothers] will certainly plot against thee (Q.12:5b) and thereby manifestly kill their own selves out of  a [misguided] love of God (muhabbat Allah)  abstracted from  [love for] thy Self, the True One. [12] God, verily, hath willed  what He hath willed for thy [Jospeh= Ḥusayn’s] sake;  namely, that [He might] in very truth, [see] thy blood dye the earth crimson [through martyrdom]. [13] God, verily, hath willed what He hath willed that He might see thy [Ḥusayn’s] hair tinged with thy blood and, as ill befits the Truth,  thy person slain [and lying] upon the earth and thy body naked upon the earth. [14] God, verily, hath willed what He hath willed that He might see thy [Ḥusayn’s] daughters and thy womenfolk,  as ill befits the Truth, captive in the hands of the infidels.  [15]  God, verily, hath willed what He hath willed that He might see the faces of thy [Ḥusayn’s]  fellow Shi`is at thy sides  reddened with the dye of their  persons [their blood] and, as ill befits the Truth, their wounded  torsos discarded about the earth. [16] So disclose nothing of that which God hath ordained for thy [Husayn's] being as regards the secreted mystery of the martyrdom  [testimony] of the Divine Oneness (shahādat al- ahadiyiyya), for thine own sake, not even a single letter of a portion  of  the account [of the vision, al-qawl). [17] If  thou should inform them [the brothers] of but the slightest  portion of thy  circumstances (amr) which are,  in very truth,  secreted in mystery,  they [the brothers] would at that very moment sacrifice themselves  before thee [Joseph / Ḥusayn] for the love of God (muhabbat Allah), yearning deeply for God  on account of [reunion with?] thine own  self [Joseph/ Ḥusayn]. And God, as befits the Truth, is well-disposed towards His servants. [18] God it is who, no God is there except Him, confirms this wondrous episode  [narrative regarding Joseph= Ḥusayn] (al hadíth ) perchance the people, as befits the truth, might render praise and be thankful for the  verses  of their  Lord,  the All-Merciful regarding  the ways of the Gate (subul al-bāb).<br />		  <br />		   [19] The brothers of Joseph [Ḥusayn] discovered  a  trace (ḥarf an lit. `letter’)  of  the hidden mystery of his [Joseph's = Ḥusayn’s future?]  situation  ("Cause", amr ) despite its being the mystery deeply veiled by the glorious mystery. [ 20] In  consequence, the ordinances of the Prophets (sunnan al-nabiyyīn)  and the witnesses [martyrs]  (al-shuhadā')  about killing in His Path (al-qaṭl fi sabilihi),  were carried out.   And God is witness unto all things. [21] After the slaughter  of Joseph the unbelief of Satan increased and on this account was he [Satan] reckoned  one cursed  on the part of the All-Merciful and His sanctified ones (as*fiyā)  for  such was, in very truth, stipulated in all the [scriptural] Tablets (al-alwāḥ). [22] And subsequent to his unbelief he [Satan], as ill befits the Truth,  hatched a terrible plot against the Most-Great Word (al-kalimat al- akbar).

Q. 24:40].  [24] And He will inform such as have oppressed Us that they shall not be able to outstrip [or: compete with] Us over  even a letter of the knowledge of the Book. By virtue of God, the Exalted, We, in very truth, encompass [with Our knowledge] all the worlds.  [25] In the Mother Book (umm al-kitab)  God  secretly reckoned thee [the Bāb]  among the five [immaculate ones?],  they who are  hidden and mysteriously concealed  (al-khamsat al khifayya al-mustasirr   sirr an).

This according to the decree of the Book (hukm al-kitab) concealed about the [Sinaitic] Fire (al-nar).

[34] We disclosed unto the servants (al-'ubud) something of the Cause (al-amr) though the people remained, in very Truth, destitute (makhdul an) thereof.

On this Surah Mohammadhosseini relates: "In chapter 28 (Súrat al-Qarába) the Báb addresses the immediate members of his family, wondering why they have not already recognized his high station from his angel-like morality, dignity and divine behaviour. He proclaims that he is the promised Proof (Hujja) of God. He states that if they accept his new Cause, God will forgive their past sins, grant them double reward and send them to Paradise. In the same chapter, he praises the sublime station of Fatima Bagum, his mother, saying that she should recognize her own station and appreciate her long association with him, designating her the Mother of the Believers (Umm al-Mu'minin). In the hundredth chapter, he beseeches God to grant her faith in the new Cause. The Báb's wife, Khadijih Bagum, is told in chapter 28 that if she accepts his Cause, she will not be like ordinary women. He references her in relation to her shared name with Muhammad's first wife (Khadijih). He urges her to realize her sublime station and the honour of her association with him. He comforts and consoles her over the death of their son, Ahmad, who is now in Paradise." (Mohammadhosseini, AMNP, p. 9) and "In chapter 28 the Báb asserts that the mystery of his Revelation is so abstruse and perplexing that no person except he who has absolutely turned to God and his might can unravel it. Statements closely resembling this are found in several other places in the Qayyúm al-Asmá" [p. 13]. In this chapter, He states that his family is descended from Fátimih, the daughter of Muhammad.</li><li>"In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate" | بسم اللّه الرّحمن الرّحيم</li><li>"But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied and he is truthful."

A full prov. transl. is available by <a href="https://hurqalya.ucmerced.edu/node/131/">Lambden</a>.</li><ul><li>In this surih the Bab states about Himself that "he is not but a servant (*abd) of God and the gate (báb) of the Remnant of God [baqiyyatullah]...". (Mohammadhosseini, AMNP, p. 16). In pursuit of His ethical vision of tolerance, forberance, and avoidance of causing grief, He forbids believers form entering the house of anyone without their consent. The figure of the 'Maiden', which becomes a major focal point in later Baha'i texts [cf. <a>[[Suriy-i-Haykal]]</a> ], has its earliest origins in this Surih. This celestial vision is clearly connected to the themes of the verse relevant to this Surih [12:28] and the events at this point in the story of Joseph. Lambden notes, "The immediate religious background to the motif of the divine Maiden in Baha'i scripture is then, to be found in the 29th Sura of the QA which is partly a commentary on Qur'an 12:27 which literally concerns the act of a woman (traditionally Zulayika daughter of Potiphera) tearing Joseph's shirt or robe (qamīṣ). It was perhaps the female figure's role in this qur'anic verse which led the Bāb, along with other factors such as the role of feminine beauty in Persianate poetry, to speak of the heavenly Maiden, who also figures significantly in other sections of surahs ("chapters") the QA... In QA 29 the Bab seems to be called upon to authorize the beautiful and unique heavenly maiden (hurriya) to emerge from her celestial palace or mansion (qaṣr) and appear on earth. This to the end that drunken or negligent human beings might be awakened by the raptuous [sic]  sight of but one of the hairs located at the back of her locks."

Then do not withdraw from the sanctuary of His presence, for, by the righteousness of the One true God, He is none other than the sovereign Truth from God; He is the most exalted One and the Source of all wisdom, as decreed in the Mother Book."

Thou shall neither fear nor utter curses for He is God, thy Master, the True One. He indeed is All-Encompassing of all of the worlds.<p>		  <br />		  O Thou believers!

This by virtue of  being aware of the directive  towards those negligent (hukm bi'l-ma'ridin) about Our Wisdom, inclining towards the fiercely blazing hellfire (nar al-jahim). In the Mother [Archetypal] Book (umm al-kitab) the punishment of God ('adhab Allah) extends for a one hundred and ten (mi'at wa 'ashar an) [year period, cf. abjad `Ali = 110].

God doth not ordain for anyone with the like of that which He hath ordained for him, the True One (al-haqq), in very Truth the Greatest (bi'l-haqq al-akbar). It is impossible for anyone that they should desire anything additional. He is the Light (al-nur) in the [Sinaitic, theophanic] Dual Mounts (al-turayn) [cf. B A B).

Likewise, he comments on the significance of the "Throne of God" as a sign of the Manifestation, also His first believer, as well as of the Cause of God and His Revelation; the reference to eight angels carrying the throne is a testimony to the fact that the Word will not at first be accepted by most people, but also 8 is equivalent to Bahá when not accounting the <i>hamzih</i> as an alef (Saiedi, Logos and Civilization, p. 199).</li><ul><li>Baha'u'llah has also mentioned this verse and the QA directly in the Tablet of Ishraaqaat, and in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, as well as frequent uses of "Crimson Ark" in numerous other tablets:</li><ul><li>"We have admonished Our loved ones to fear God, a fear which is the fountainhead of all goodly deeds and virtues.

The Báb also refers to himself elsewhere as 'this letter, kaf' and Táhirih Qurrat al-Ayn would later point out that this specific prophecy of Sayyid Kázim was fulfilled by the Báb (see Rafati, Development, pp. 181f.; and Mazandarani, Tarikh-i zuhur al-haqq, vol. 3, pp. 402 and 509).</li><li>In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate | بسم اللّه الرّحمن الرّحيم</li><li>"When they lost all hope in him, they spoke privately.

On this, Siyamak Zabihi-Moghaddam in "The Bāb on the Rights of Women" (2023) relates: "...consonant with the Qur’anic precedent (Q. 4:3) that allowed a man to have up to four wives at any one time on the condition that he treated them equitably, the Qayyūm al-Asmā’ (surah [chapter] 106) allowed the same number of wives. Similarly, with regard to inheritance, the Qayyūm al-Asmā’ (ch. 106) upheld the distinction made in Qur’anic law between male and female inheritors, including the stipulation regarding the share of male offspring being twice that of females (Q. 4:11).

Aside from the single verse by Lawson, as of yet no translations of this Surah have been identified. In the verse by Lawson, the Bab calling Himself a "ḥanīf muslim" refers to the ḥunafā monotheists (sole worship of Allah in the manner of Abraham) of pre-Islamic Arabia. Traditionally, Muhammad Himself was said to be a ḥanīf prior to His Revelation. More literally it means "one inclining toward truth" [cf. Q3:67]. The Bab underscores His return to Pure Religion in claiming this status and exemplifies His ascendance over the claims and standards of knowledge among 'ulema. This Surah contains statements regarding the rank and station of the first to believe in the Bab (the sābiqīn, or 'those who precede' [cf. Quran 46:11; Q56:10]), that is, the <a>[[Letters of the Living]]</a>, as they were known in the earlier years of the Dispensation of the Bab. This term, an altogether more Quranic/Islamic than the later more fully Babi term Huruf-i-Hayy, is an example of the Bab's early efforts to retain a degree of Islamic tone to His revelation prior to unveiling its full scope and newness. Mohammadhosseini describes this dynamic as follows: "The Báb says that his early writings are based on Quranic concepts and gradually develop into Bayánic ones. And, as it is more developed, the purpose of God is more explicit in the Bayán. A general look at the Báb's writings, and particularly the connection between the early and the later writings (intrinsic contextuality), will demonstrate the veracity of the claim of the Báb about his station."

In the first chapter of the Qayyūm al-asmāʾ, the phrase “al-dīn al-khāliṣ” is used four times to announce that the book makes significant claims on religion. The Bāb states (1:12) “The Pure Religion (al-dīn al-khāliṣ) of this Remembrance (Dhikr) is well preserved (sālim). Whomsoever desireth Islam, let him submit to his Cause (al-amr) so that God will inscribe him in the book of the righteous as a Muslim and of the pure religion (al-dīn al-khāliṣ), which God in truth hath praised”.5 Utilizing a whole repertoire of Quranic vocabulary in this verse, the Bāb explains that he is articulating the pure religion of God, which is both Islam and the Cause (al-amr) associated with him, both of which are God’s pure religion. The Bāb clearly references a religion associated with himself here twice. First, he refers to “the pure religion of this Remembrance (Dhikr)”."</li></ul><li>Bab, and Babbiyah</li><ul><li>The word Bab/abwab occurs numerous times in nearly every Surah of the QA.

(prov., Lawson)</li></ul><li>Paradise</li><li>Badí‘, Abda'</li><ul><li>wondrous, new. unique, marvellous, wonderful, astonishing, surprising, rare.</li><li>Lawson has, analyzing this word, identified around 60 uses in the adverbial form (badii'an) and numerous other uses; other notable adjectival uses include al-dhikr al-badi (“the wondrously new and creative Remembrance (of God)”); al-ayat al-badi (“the wondrously new and creative divine verses”); al-kalimat al-badi (“the creative, wondrous divine Word”); al-haqq al-badi (“the wondrously new Absolute and unchangeable divine Truth”); al-amr al-badi (“the wondrously new divine eternal Cause”); al-nar al-badi (“the wondrously new divine Fire”), and al-bayan al-badi (“the wondrously new divine Revelation or Apocalypse”); or even al-tafsir al-badi “this (dhalika) wondrously new Tafsir/Explanation (of the Quran)” QA110:41. Introducing the theme he states: "The frequent instances of the term badi' and its derivatives (including homonyms and anagrams (as seen earlier) such as words construed on the Arabic root B-D-, in which the Arabic letter hamza -- replaces the ayn --, and means "to begin (again)", or B-DW "to appear" or "change of mind", as in the Shi'i doctrine of divine change of mind (Ayoub 1986) and synonyms, such as 'Ayn-J-B "wondrous, strange" <b>represent a sustained theme of wonder and innovation/newness throughout the Qayyum al-Asma</b>. One might say that the Qayyum al-Asmà enshrines wonder as a sacramental element of the covenant and its renewal (cf. Faber 2022, pp. 381-410, esp. 389 and 411 n.1). To give some idea of the way in which this highly charged word circulates through the Qayyum al-Asma the following breakdown is offered." (Lawson, 'The Role of Wonder...' p. 12)</li><li>"Whereas <a>[[Ibn Arabi]]</a> spoke of the "mercification" of existence as the ontological and cosmogonic process par excellence (Beneito 1998), the Bab seems to opt for something like the "wondrification" of existence for the same phenomenon and process. As mentioned, throughout the history of Islamic thought there have been various metaphorizations for the discussion of cosmogony and ontology. For Avicenna (<a>[[Ibn Sina]]</a>) the term was, in fact, being (wujud), for <a>[[Suhrawardi]]</a> , the central cosmogonic and ontic principle was light (nür), for Ibn 'Arabi it was, as mentioned, mercy (rahma), and for <a>[[Mulla Sadra]]</a> it was motion (haraka jawhariyya). For the Bab the ontic principle emerges as wonder: wonder is created through the wondrous, original and innovative creative power of God, al-Badi, The Originator, par excellence (as in Q2:117 and 6:101) and the result of this creative power, what the uninitiated might call "mere" creation is also wonder and wondrousness (al-insha al-badi', as in QA104:5). The source of this wonder is, again, the apophatic divinity who simply cannot be known, but somehow is. Both form and contents, subject and object are saturated in wonder, originality and the new. The related word bid a "heresy" which also means novelty, is thus addressed by virtue of etymological contiguity. The Bab seems to be saying, among many other things, that just because something was not found in the Sunna (which word, as we saw, is a perfect antonym for badi) does not mean that it is de facto heretical. Thus, in some sense, the whole notion of heresy is neutralized or at least recreated, reconstrued." (Lawson, 'The Role of Wonder...', p. 18)</li></ul><li>Upright alif (al-alif al-qaim)</li><ul><li>cf. QA91,</li><li>In Sufism, symbolic of the 'standing' phase of the Salih (obligatory prayer).

The Bab deliberately modeled the concept of jihad in the Qayyūm al-Asmā’ and in other works written before the Persian Bayān on the Shiʿi concept of jihad.17 In a later work, the Dalā’il-i-Sab‘ih, the Bab clarifies that, in the Qayyūm al-Asmā’, he enjoined the observance of the laws of the Qur’an, so that his audience “might regard His Faith as similar to their own, perchance they would not turn away from the Truth…”18” (Zabihi-Moghaddam, “The Babi–State Conflicts of 1848–50" in Vahman, The Bab and the Babi Community of Iran)</li></ul><li>the Evil One, Satan</li><ul><li>cf.

Its use here by the Báb offers yet another example of how the work, if not the thought, of one of history's greatest mystics had thoroughly permeated Iranian Shi'i spiritual discourse (irfan) by this time. The term ahadiyya "exclusive divine unity" represents the highest aspect of the Absolute about which man can notion (if one may use a noun as a verb), but does not, of course, define the Absolute which must always be beyond whatever occurs about It in the human mind. The term wahidiyya "inclusive divine unity" refers to the next highest aspect of the Absolute, the aspect which involves the "appearance" of the divine names and attributes. The proper understanding of this technical terminology has been a subject of scholarly debate in Iran for centuries. The term wahidiyya recurs over and over again in the course of this commentary. It appears to be descriptive of one of the degrees of divinity that constitutes the whole hierarchical metaphysical structure of the cosmos. It is the degree immediately inferior to the divine exclusive unity (ahadiyya). Again, such terminology betrays the influence of the so-called wahdat al-wujud school associated with Ibn Arabi."</li></ul><li>The Gate as necessary to the Spiritual Journey; cf.
